# DevCon3 Group 1 GDD

### Description:
To simulate physics, our group went with simulating physics on a cannon projectile! For that, we shoot the projectile out of a cannon, let it roll across the ground, and bounce it off of |Landmines|. 
.
.

### What functionality we need to make:
 1. Cannon controls (We went with a mini-game)'
 2. Landmines (and spawning them in)
 3. Colliders and collision behaviors
 4. Camera movement
 5. and anything else we want to add!

### Some assets that'd make things look nice:
 1. Scrolling Background
 2. Scrolling flat ground (like. the ground ground)
 3. Our "Projectile"
 4. Cannon assets


## Play test Stuff!
### Questions:
1. What do you guys think? Is our core mechanic fun?
2. What does our game remind you of? Is there anything you guys would love to see added?
3. Do you think our game was easy to control? should we add extra keys to control our cannon?

### Responses:
1. "Cool!" was the main response to the 1st half. The other group seemed enthusiastic to play our game! (we had to stream footage to them, none of them wanted to bypass their firewall to run the build)
2. The feedback we got for ideation was similar to our own ideation! both groups were talking about adding controls to simulate more physics while our projectile was in the air. There was also a cool concept for adding additional points of gravity, similar to things like Angry Birds (the Star Wars edition)
3. We mentioned that we wrote this question down, then described our controls to the other group. They said it'd be best if we added an indicator of what button we needed to press, and we all agreed that that'd be best for our final version. That's about as good as we can do for feedback in this category, so we were all satisfied.
