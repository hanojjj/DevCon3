# DevCon3 Group 1 GDD

### Description:
To simulate physics, our group went with simulating physics on a cannon projectile! For that, we shoot the projectile out of a cannon, let it roll across the ground, and bounce it off of |Landmines|. 
.
.

### What functionality we need to make:
 1. Cannon controls (We went with a mini-game)'
 2. Landmines (and spawning them in)
 3. Colliders and collision behaviors
 4. Camera movement
 5. and anything else we want to add!

### Some assets that'd make things look nice:
 1. Scrolling Background
 2. Scrolling flat ground (like. the ground ground)
 3. Our "Projectile"
 4. Cannon assets
